# profile.me

This is a simple one page website that shares my personal information about me and links to my personal profiles.

## instruction

if you clone this and want to make your own 

rename the config.js to api.js and add you webhook there

because i let my Git ignore my api.js. therefore, i don't have to expose my api webhook
